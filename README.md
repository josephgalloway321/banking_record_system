# Banking Record System

**Author:** Joseph D. Galloway II </br>
**Description:**
This program is a terminal-based interface for Happy Bank. It's a fictional bank that allows users to create, delete, and login to their account. After logging in, users can deposit their money, withdraw their money, check their current balance, and transfer money to another user's account. All the account data is read from and saved to a txt file at the start and end of the program. </br>

**Path to Executable:** banking_record_system/cmake-build-debug/banking_record_system.exe </br>

This project helped me practice the following concepts using C++: 
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Creating a class and header file 
- Pass by reference using Vectors
- Input/Output Files using the <fstream> library
- Exception handling  </br>

**Future Work for Version 2 (v2):**
- Include username & password for each user to improve login security
- Create a GUI for program
- Use a database to store account information instead of a txt file
- Use End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
